# K-Mean-Algorithm-
In this project I have implemented the K mean clustering algorithm in Python. K mean clustering is basically an algorithm of unsupervised learning where you classify the items of dataset into K no of groups
In order to decide the best value of K in this algo I have used Davies Bouldin Index
